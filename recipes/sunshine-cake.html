<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    I am going to be honest with all of you. I have never had sunshine cake. But Minol, why are you recommending it on your super-cool,
    super-pretty recipe website? That should be obvious, dear reader. It's called "sunshine cake". I simply had to include it.
</p>
<p>
    Also it is quick and easy. Are you seeing a pattern yet?
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>18 ounces moist yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Half cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>11 ounces mandarin oranges (can, juice reserved)</li>
        <li>16 ounces frozen whipped topping (thawed)</li>
        <li>5 ounces instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>20 ounces crushed pineapple with juice</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs, and add them to the boxed cake mix. Add the oil and the mandarin oranges to the batter; remember to add the juice as well as the fruit. Pour the batter into a greased and floured 9 x 13 inch pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the cake for 40 minutes in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cool on wire rack.</li>
        <li>While cake is baking, prepare the frosting by mixing together the whipped dessert topping, the package of instant pudding, and the crushed pineapple with its juices. Set frosting in refrigerator to set. Frost when cake has thoroughly cooled.</li>
